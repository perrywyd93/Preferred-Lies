        <p class="course-info">Aronimink Golf Club is not a course that the every day golfer is familiar with. It's located about an hour North West of Philadelphia
          and my goodness is it worth the drive. This club takes golf back to the glory days, with only about 10-15 golf carts on property
          for those with a disability. What they lack in technology, they more than make up for with a thriving caddy program.
          In my opinion, a good caddy program can make just about any golf trip better. It allows us more time to interact with the golf
          and take it all that the architect has to offer.</p>
        <p class="course-info">And that's what the trip to Aronimink was all about for my foursome (all four
          of us were on summer internships for the PGA Golf Management program at Coastal Carolina University).
          Donald Ross will always be one of my favorite architects, and Aronimink was no different. From blind tee shots to turtle-backed greens,
          this golf course is one that's going to make you think your entire way around.</p>
        <p class="course-info">If you are looking for a course to hack it around on, then maybe it's best to keep the search going. But if you're a glutton
          for punishment like me, Aronimink Golf Club is going to give you all that you can handle.

        <p class="course-info about">
          Ever since I began playing golf seriously when I got to high school, my life was pretty much all golf all the time.
          This is why I became a PGA Golf Professional in the first place. By the time I turned 26 though, I had become pretty
          much burnt out on the business side of golf.
        </p>
        <p class="course-info about">
          This meant that it was time for a career change. I had reached a point where if golf was involved, then great!
          But my first priority was finding something more suited to my strengths and more rewarding financially. After a random
          burst of inspiration from the HBO show "Silicon Valley", I decided it was worth looking into web development.
        </p>
        <p class="course-info about">
          The basic structure of this page was created about 10 days after I took my first free class from Codecademy.com. I hope
          to one day be able to combine my love for golf with my new career path in web development. Until then, I'm trading in my spikes
          for a laptop and a monitor.
